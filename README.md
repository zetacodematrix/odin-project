## Workflow

Project development follows a consistent version-control process:

- Add files incrementally to staging  
- Commit with clear, descriptive messages  
- Push when features or milestones are complete  
- Maintain a clear progression log throughout the curriculum  

This structure supports transparency, maintainability, and reproducibility.
