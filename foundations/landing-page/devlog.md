## Overview

Today’s work focused on building out the full semantic HTML structure for the Asimov-themed landing page as part of The Odin Project’s Landing Page assignment. The goal was to progress from a bare scaffold to a clean, accessible HTML layout ready for styling.

## Commits & Progress

### 1. Initial scaffold  
**Commit:** `Add initial semantic structure for langing page`  
- Set up the base HTML document and added initial semantic regions (`header`, `main`, `footer`).  
- Added placeholder text and proper document structure for later expansion.

---

### 2. Header, nav, and hero section  
**Commit:** `Add header structure with logo, navigation, and hero section skeleton`  
- Added a top-level header containing:  
  - Logo placeholder  
  - Navigation menu using proper list-based HTML  
- Created the hero section with main heading + descriptive text placeholders.  
- This sets the stage for the visual identity of the landing page.

### 3. Info-card scaffolding  
**Commit:** `Add info cards, scaffold with card-container`  
- Added a new section in `<main>` dedicated to “info cards.”  
- Introduced a parent container to hold multiple cards.  
- Each card includes a heading and paragraph placeholder.

---

### 4. Image placeholders & captions  
**Commit:** `Add image placeholders and captions to info-cards`  
- Each info card now includes a `<figure>` block with:  
  - Image placeholder  
  - `<figcaption>` describing the image  
- Improved accessibility with alt attributes ready for future refinement.

---

### 5. Full semantic pass  
**Commit:** `Finish semantic structure for landing page`  
- Cleaned up section hierarchy and ensured proper heading order.  
- Removed redundant wrappers and improved readability.  
- Ensured each part of the page has a clear semantic purpose.

---

### 6. Final semantic polish  
**Commit:** `Finalize semantic HTML structure for Asimov-themed landing page`  
- Final re-organization of IDs, section labels, and descriptive text to align with Asimov styling/lore.  
- Confirmed the HTML is ready for styling and responsive design implementation.  

---

## Current Status

- All semantic HTML for the Asimov landing page is complete.  
- Structure is clean, accessible, and easy to style.  
- No CSS yet — HTML is now locked in and ready for the next Odin Project milestone.

---

## Next Steps

- Begin CSS layout (flexbox/grid for cards and hero section).  
- Develop an Asimov-inspired sci-fi visual theme (colors, borders, typography).  
- Add responsive breakpoints for mobile → tablet → desktop.  
- Replace placeholder images with final assets.
